# Spring Ball #

For the spring ball Hikari is wearing a black gown obviously inspired by a certain silver-coated foxcat. The dress itself is a multi-layered affair with an outer layer of black silk chiffon gently embroidered with silver thread forming the basis of the a-line silhouette with a short skirt. Underneath that there's five fluffy stuffed black tails with white tips flowing out. In the final visible layer that completes the skirt and made of an almost impossibly dark fabric with stars and constellations embroidered into it.

Her hair is her usual black, in a freely flowing hime cut. Unusually she wears a diadem that has two matching foxcat ears attached to it. She wears silver earrings and studs, a pearl choker, and a long pearl bracelet.
