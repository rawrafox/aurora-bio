# Myrin ASP-4 GT #

The Myrin Shipyards ASP-4 Grand Tourer, or as most people know it the Myrin Aspa has been featured in quite a few holos and the design is somewhat infamous for being able to combine a powerful microwarp drive with the ability to host a party in the back, a combination that doesn't always end well.

The black shuttle is a Gallente design with big engines and long smooth lines that just make it _look fast_. It's kind of ship a rich Gallente playboy or a Cartel hotshot might cruise around in for fun or profit. The shuttle hull is about 8m long and not much more than 3m tall, smaller than common Interbus VIP craft â€” and less than a fifth of the length of a standard capsuleer shuttle.
